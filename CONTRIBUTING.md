## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| [JDK](https://adoptium.net/) | **21+** | Required (virtual threads) |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | 2.x+ | For cloning and contributing |
| [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) | Latest | Recommended IDE (Lombok and Gradle support built-in) |

For running the server locally:

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Hypixel API key | Required for most Hypixel/SkyBlock endpoints |
| MariaDB or Docker | For database-backed features |
| Environment variables | `HYPIXEL_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` |

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   [Fork the repository](https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/server/fork),
   then clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/server.git
   cd server
   ```

2. **Clone dependency modules alongside** (for local development)

   This module depends on [server-api](https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/server-api)
   (`dev.sbs:server-api:0.1.0`) and [minecraft-api](https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/minecraft-api)
   (`dev.sbs:minecraft-api:0.1.0`). Clone them alongside this repository for
   local development with Gradle composite builds.

   ```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/minecraft-api.git
   git clone https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/server-api.git
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   The Gradle wrapper is included - no separate Gradle installation is needed.

   ```bash
   cd server
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA**

   Open the project root as a Gradle project. IntelliJ will automatically
   detect the `build.gradle.kts` and import dependencies. Ensure the Lombok
   plugin is installed and annotation processing is enabled
   (`Settings > Build > Compiler > Annotation Processors`).

5. **Verify the setup**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- Create a feature branch from `master` for your work.
- Use a descriptive branch name: `fix/mojang-uuid-parsing`,
  `feat/skyblock-bingo-endpoint`, `docs/endpoint-examples`.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-feature master
```

### Code Style

#### General

- **Spring conventions** - Follow standard Spring Boot patterns for
  `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@Configuration`, and `@Bean`.
- **Collections** - Always use `Concurrent.newList()`, `Concurrent.newMap()`,
  `Concurrent.newSet()` instead of `new ArrayList`, `new HashMap`, etc.
- **Annotations** - Use `@NotNull` / `@Nullable` from `org.jetbrains.annotations`
  on all public method parameters and return types.
- **Lombok** - Use `@Getter`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, `@Log4j2`, etc.
  where appropriate. The logger field is non-static
  (`lombok.log.fieldIsStatic = false`).
- **OpenAPI annotations** - Annotate controllers with `@Tag` (class-level) and
  `@Operation` / `@Parameter` (method-level) from `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations`.

#### Braces

- Omit curly braces when the `if` body is a single line.
- Use curly braces when the body wraps across multiple lines.

#### Javadoc

- **Class level** - Noun phrase describing what the type is.
- **Method level** - Active verb, third person singular, describing what the
  method does.
- **Tags** - Always include `@param`, `@return`, `@throws` on public methods.
  Tag descriptions are lowercase sentence fragments with no trailing period.
  Single space after the param name (no column alignment).
- **Punctuation** - Only use single hyphens (` - `) as separators. Never em
  dashes, `&mdash;`, or double hyphens.
- Never use `@author` or `@since`.

#### Controllers

- Each controller class maps to a single upstream API domain (Mojang, Hypixel,
  SkyBlock, Resources).
- Use `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)` on all endpoint methods.
- Delegate to `minecraft-api` Feign clients via private helper methods
  (`endpoint()`, `proxy()`) rather than injecting Spring beans.
- Group related endpoints under a shared `@RequestMapping` base path.

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that describe *what* changed and *why*.

```
Add garden endpoint to SkyBlock controller

Proxies the Hypixel SkyBlock garden API for fetching garden data by
profile ID.
```

- Use the imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Update", not "Added", "Fixes").
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- Add a body when the *why* isn't obvious from the subject.

### Testing

Tests use JUnit 5 (Jupiter):

```bash
./gradlew test
```

- Add tests for new functionality where practical.
- Many endpoints depend on live upstream APIs and database state, so not all
  controller methods can be unit tested in isolation. Integration tests that
  require a running server or external services should be clearly documented.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork.

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-feature
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request** against the `master` branch of
   [SkyBlock-Simplified/server](https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/server).

3. **In the PR description**, include:
   - A summary of the changes and the motivation behind them.
   - Steps to test or verify the changes.
   - Whether the change adds new API endpoints or modifies existing ones.

4. **Respond to review feedback.** PRs may go through one or more rounds of
   review before being merged.

### What gets reviewed

- Correctness of endpoint mappings and upstream client delegation.
- OpenAPI annotation completeness (`@Tag`, `@Operation`, `@Parameter`).
- Impact on the public API surface. New endpoints or breaking changes to
  existing endpoints should be discussed in the issue tracker before
  implementation.
- Adherence to the controller patterns established by existing controllers.
- Compatibility with the `server-api` framework (error handling, security
  headers, message converters).

## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SkyBlock-Simplified/server/issues)
to report bugs or request features.

When reporting a bug, include:

- **Java version** (`java --version`)
- **Spring Boot version** (check `gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- **Operating system**
- **Full error stacktrace** (if applicable)
- **Request URL and response** (if applicable)
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**

## Project Architecture

A brief overview to help you find your way around the codebase:

```
src/main/java/dev/sbs/simplifiedserver/
├── SimplifiedServer.java              # Spring Boot entry point with Gson bean
├── config/
│   └── OpenApiConfig.java             # OpenAPI metadata (title, description, version)
└── controller/
    ├── MojangController.java          # /mojang/ - profile, username, UUID, properties, bulk
    ├── HypixelController.java         # /hypixel/ - player, guild, status, counts, games
    ├── SkyBlockController.java        # /skyblock/ - profiles, auctions, bazaar, museum, garden
    └── ResourceController.java        # /resources/ - skills, collections, items, election
```

### Key extension points

- **New controller** - Add a `@RestController` in `controller/` with `@Tag`
  and `@Operation` annotations. Delegate to upstream `minecraft-api` Feign
  clients.
- **Custom error body** - Override `ErrorController.buildErrorBody()` from
  `server-api` to return a project-specific JSON error response type.
- **Custom Gson** - The `Gson` `@Bean` in `SimplifiedServer` controls the
  serializer used for all JSON responses. Modify it to customize serialization.
- **Server tuning** - Replace `ServerConfig.optimized()` with
  `ServerConfig.builder()` for fine-grained control over Tomcat, compression,
  HTTP/2, and other server settings.
